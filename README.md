Here you will find questions that are most asked in our #tech-support channel.

### Root

### What is root?

In short,it allows you to do things that would require privilege that you would not normally have a non-rooted system.Think of it as the Windows Administrator system,on windows you would need admin privileges to run a program,if you didn’t have that permission the program wouldn’t run.Same applies to root,it would not allow you to run say an ad-blocker or a theme app such as Substratum.

### Alright,so what do I get with root?

You can enjoy features such as :-
-Extensive Theming (Substratum)
-Better adblock solutions (Adaway)
-Better backup solutions (Titanium Backup and oandbackup)
-Xposed (before nougat)
and many more!

### Sounds cool but,what are the cons?

Unfortunately,they are some cons :-

-Decreased security
-Warranty becomes obsolete (most of the time)
-Chance of bricking your device

### Bricking,that sounds scary!

Most of the time,bricking is quite scary.There are two types of bricking :-
Soft Bricking
Hard Bricking

For soft bricking,it can usually be fixed,but it takes some time,most of the problems we get in here are about people soft-bricking their device.

For hard bricking,it is usually not fixable.Sometimes,it is caused by a hardware issue (such as the LG g4 notorious for randomly hard bricking itself)  and sometimes it is caused by software.

Bootlooping usually happens when you hard-brick or soft-brick your phone , the phone constantly tries to boot and never boots.

Kingoroot/Kingroot is also a notorious rooting software,never root with this rooting method.

Rooting a phone that came out a few months ago such as the s8/s8+ is strictly ill-advised
